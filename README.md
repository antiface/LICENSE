# LICENSE
* Here's the fundamental problem that I, as interdisciplinary artist and independent researcher, have with current state-of-the-art as far as Licensing agreements go: There are no current licenses that work for me. That's the basic fact of the matter. Since no licenses exist that cover what I do as well as giving me the protections I need, I am forced to write my own license, which will be unique to my work, and hopefully will someday be legally binding.
* Now. The problem with that is I'm not a legal expert. So whatever you read on this or other public Github repositories created by me, is technically all covered by the actual, legally-binding licenses I have put in each repository, usually an Artistic License 2.0.
* Again, I only choose the Artistic License 2.0 because that's the only one available. What I mean is that when I create a new public repository on Github, I can choose to put a license in it, but of the licenses that Github gives me access to, none are adequate. The Artistic License 2.0 is the best one I could find out of the bunch, so I generally use that one.
* Another problem: Most of the time, I'm not actually writing source code on my public Github repositories. That causes a problem. Same problem as before, no licenses currently exist for what I'm doing.
* A lot of what I do, in my professional painting practise, let's say, is perhaps best described as a sort of "business method". It's not a business method per se, usually it's just a unique technique or methodology that I use in my art practise. But it's not necessarily something I can copyright OR patent, given current state-of-the-art as far as licenses go.
* So this public repository is dedicated to trying to work out a license that works for me, that protects the intellectual property that I'd like to protect as licensor, and that also gives rights over to licensees who might be interested in my work.

* Anything that I have said or done, created or developed or thought that was provably uniquely my independent creation will forever be solely my intellectual property as well as solely the intellectual property of my Succession, now and forever;
* It must be something that I did, invented, created, developed, worked on, worked out, and it must be unique;
* It must have my SIGNATURE or one of my SIGNATURES; If it does not have my signature, it cannot be my own freely and independently created cultural material;
* My "work" can never be used without my permission; it cannot even be referenced or linked to without my permission;
* (to be continued... this is still binding as I develop it further..)
