SOURCING
========
## As Artist and Independent Scholar:
  * My Sources are confidential;
  * My Sources are privileged;
  * My Sources are exclusive;
  * My Sources are my OWN.

## Source Code:
* What I'd like to say about the content that I commit to my public Github repositories is that it is technically "Open Source". What I mean by that is that the "source" itself is "open", i.e. you can LOOK at the source.
* The problem is that most of what I commit to these public repositories is NOT exactly "source code". So what I want to do is to think of "open source" as having two version. The first, I want to call "White Source", meaning it's just ordinary, everyday, plain vanilla "open source". The other form I think best describes my work as an artist and researcher, I would call "Black Source". That means that it's "open source" but that it is confidential, privileged information, that it cannot be copied or distributed, etc. You could almost say it is "classified" in an informal way. You can "look at the source" but that's about all you can do. Everything else is forbidden, covered by the licensing agreement.
* One might say that this is what Copyright, All Rights Reserved means, and fundamentally, yes, that's precisely what Copyright, All Rights Reserved is all about. The problem is that some of what I do cannot be protected by copyright. That is, it is in between normal "copyrightable" intellectual property and what one might call "business methods" or trademarks which might be patented.
* That's the problem, I work somewhere in the grey zone between art, design, and business. That's why I am focused these days on writing a manual for what I call "Art Operations". More on that later...
